Salar De Uyuni, Bolivia
Uyuni
Sabaya
186 miles

Cycling atop the salt crust of Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni – and the more petite but perfectly-formed Salar de Coipasa – is an undisputed highlight of many a South America journey. It’s a high-altitude ride that takes five or six days, segmented by an opportunity to resupply with water and food at the midway settlement of Llica.

As the largest salt flat in the world, cycling here provides an other-worldly experience. There’s nothing quite like pitching your tent on a bleached white canvas, seasoning your dinner with the salty ground on which you’re sitting, and awakening in the morning to a glow of ethereal, lavender light.

This journey can only be undertaken in Bolivia’s winter, as during summer the salt lakes are inundated by seasonal rain.
